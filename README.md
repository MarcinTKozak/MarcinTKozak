About me
-  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marcin. I am studying to be a software tester and in the future QA Automation Engineer.  

What I am learning now?

I am in the process of uTest Academy, and in my free time I am preparing to ISTQB exam. I am also learning about tools for automation testing (Selenium, Cucumber, Serenity BDD, Jenkins)

I am learning a lot from:
